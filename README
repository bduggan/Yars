Yars (Yet Another RESTAS Server)

Lightweight version built on the Clustericious framework.  This is currently just a developer tool and shouldn't be used for serious production work.  Use RESTAS-Server instead.

Install the package:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install


Create a config file (~/etc/Yars.conf) that looks something like this:

---
data_dir : /tmp/yars
url : http://localhost:9050

Create the directory listed for data_dir.
