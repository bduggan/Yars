RESTAS-Yarc (Yet Another RESTAS Server)

Lightweight version built on the Clustericious framework.  This is currently just a developer tool and shouldn't be used for serious production work.  Use RESTAS-Server instead.

Install the package:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install


Create a config file (~/etc/RESTAS.conf) that looks something like this:

---
data_dir : /tmp/restas
url : http://localhost:9050
port : 9050
host : localhost


Make this symbolic link:

ln -s ~/etc/RESTAS.conf ~/etc/RESTAS\:\:Yars.conf

This is a workaround to allow RESTAS::Yars to use the Clustericious system of config files, while keeping it out of the main namespace of RESTAS.  Note that RESTAS::Yarc also uses RESTAS.conf, but needs no symbolic link.
